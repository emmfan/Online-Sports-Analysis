# Online-Sports-Analysis
In this project, I take on the role of a data analyst for an online sports clothing company, with the primary goal of identifying strategies to increase revenue. My analysis will focus on key product attributes, including pricing, customer reviews, product descriptions, and ratings, as well as associated revenue and website traffic metrics. By examining patterns and relationships within these datasets, I will generate actionable insights and recommendations to support the companyâ€™s marketing and sales teams in optimizing product performance, improving customer engagement, and driving growth.
